Great starting point! Here are some other essential authors whose works are rich in the kind of British cultural references your dictionary addresses:

**Victorian/19th Century (the mother lode):**

- Charles Dickens - obviously, for social classes, London life, legal system
- Anthony Trollope - ecclesiastical England, political life, class distinctions
- George Eliot - provincial life, social conventions
- Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë - Yorkshire settings, governess life
- Thomas Hardy - rural Wessex, agriculture, country life
- William Makepeace Thackeray - upper-middle class society
- Elizabeth Gaskell - industrial North vs. South divide
- Wilkie Collins - sensation novels with lots of social detail

**Edwardian/Early 20th Century:**

- E.M. Forster - class tensions, British abroad
- P.G. Wodehouse - aristocracy, servants, country houses, slang
- Evelyn Waugh - upper class satire
- Virginia Woolf - intellectual/Bloomsbury circles

**Earlier:**

- Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett - 18th century picaresque
- Fanny Burney - late 18th century manners

Which periods are you thinking of emphasizing? Given American readers typically encounter Austen, Dickens, and the Brontës in school, those seem like your core tier. Trollope and Wodehouse might be second tier - less universally read but incredibly rich in exactly the cultural terminology you're cataloging.

Excellent additions! Here are more essential authors, especially strong in those areas:

**Golden Age Crime:**

- Margery Allingham - rich in class distinctions, village life
- Ngaio Marsh - (New Zealand-born but very British settings)
- Josephine Tey - Scottish and English settings, historical mysteries
- Edmund Crispin - Oxford academic settings, witty
- Gladys Mitchell - eccentric but packed with British detail

**British Light Comedy/Social Comedy:**

- **E.F. Benson** - the Mapp and Lucia novels are absolute gold for social conventions, small-town hierarchies, class pretensions
- **Nancy Mitford** - essential for upper-class life, U and Non-U language distinctions
- Barbara Pym - excellent on middle-class, church, and academic life
- **Georgette Heyer** - Regency novels incredibly detailed on period language, social customs, forms of address
- Elizabeth von Arnim - lighter social comedy, country house life

**Others worth considering:**

- Rose Macaulay - satirical novels
- Richmal Crompton - Just William books (children's perspective on class and manners)
- Daphne du Maurier - Cornwall, country estates, though more gothic

For your dictionary's purposes, I'd particularly emphasize **E.F. Benson** and **Nancy Mitford** - they're absolutely loaded with exactly the kind of social terminology and conventions Americans struggle with. Benson's "Mapp and Lucia" series is a masterclass in British social pretension and village politics.

Absolutely! Can't believe I missed those two giants. Here are more from that late Victorian/pre-WWI golden period:

**Essential:**

- **Conan Doyle** - Holmes stories are packed with Victorian London, social hierarchies, professions, colonial Empire
- **Saki (H.H. Munro)** - devastating satire of Edwardian upper-class house parties, social cruelty, brilliant dialogue

**Others from this era:**

- **Jerome K. Jerome** - _Three Men in a Boat_ especially, Thames culture, Victorian male friendship, humor
- **Rudyard Kipling** - Empire, India, public school culture (_Stalky & Co._), Anglo-Indian terminology
- **Oscar Wilde** - society comedies loaded with class distinctions and witty social observation
- John Galsworthy - _The Forsyte Saga_, upper-middle class property and propriety
- Arnold Bennett - Five Towns novels, Midlands industrial life, social mobility
- H.G. Wells - social novels like _Kipps_, _Mr. Polly_ (lower-middle class aspirations)
- W.W. Jacobs - working-class and maritime life, though perhaps less central

**Somerville and Ross** - Irish Big House novels, hunting culture (_The Irish R.M._)

For your dictionary, Conan Doyle and Saki are absolute musts - Doyle for the breadth of Victorian society and Saki for that razor-sharp Edwardian social vocabulary. Jerome K. Jerome is wonderfully rich in Thames/rowing/inn culture too.

**Essential English Poets (most frequently quoted/alluded to in the novels):**

**The Big Three you'll see everywhere:**

- **Tennyson** - quoted constantly in Victorian novels, hugely popular
- **Wordsworth** - the Romantic touchstone, nature, Lake District
- **Shakespeare** - sonnets especially, endless allusions

**Other Romantics:**

- Byron - social references, the "Byronic hero" concept
- Keats, Shelley, Coleridge
- **Robert Burns** - Scottish but essential, quoted at Burns Suppers, "Auld Lang Syne"

**Victorian:**

- Robert Browning - dramatic monologues, frequently referenced
- Matthew Arnold - "Dover Beach," cultural criticism
- Christina Rossetti
- **A.E. Housman** - _A Shropshire Lad_ was phenomenally popular, constantly quoted

**Earlier (frequently alluded to):**

- John Milton - _Paradise Lost_
- Alexander Pope - satirical, social observation
- Thomas Gray - "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" (hugely quoted)

**WWI Poets (essential for understanding post-war references):**

- Rupert Brooke - early idealistic war poetry
- Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon - disillusionment, trench warfare

**20th Century:**

- T.S. Eliot - _The Waste Land_, cultural touchstone
- Philip Larkin - postwar England

For your dictionary purposes, **Tennyson** and **Housman** are probably the most-quoted in the fiction you're covering. Every British character in a novel seems to reference "The Charge of the Light Brigade" or quote bits of _A Shropshire Lad_!

**Children's/Young Readers - Essential:**

**The absolute classics:**

- **A.A. Milne** - Pooh, Christopher Robin, quintessentially English childhood
- **Captain W.E. Johns** - Biggles, RAF, adventure stories
- **Richmal Crompton** - Just William (already mentioned, but crucial)
- **Kenneth Grahame** - _The Wind in the Willows_, Thames, English countryside
- **Beatrix Potter** - Lake District, village life, small animals
- **E. Nesbit** - _The Railway Children_, _Five Children and It_, Edwardian family life
- **Lewis Carroll** - Alice books, nonsense verse, Victorian Oxford

**School stories (hugely important for British culture):**

- **Thomas Hughes** - _Tom Brown's School Days_ (foundational public school story)
- **Frank Richards** - Billy Bunter, Greyfriars school stories
- **Enid Blyton** - Famous Five, Secret Seven, Malory Towers (boarding schools)

**Adventure/outdoor:**

- **Arthur Ransome** - _Swallows and Amazons_ series, sailing, Lake District, incredibly detailed
- R.M. Ballantyne - Victorian adventure stories

**Others:**

- Frances Hodgson Burnett - _The Secret Garden_, _Little Lord Fauntleroy_
- Robert Louis Stevenson - _Treasure Island_ (Scottish but British canon)

For your dictionary, the **school stories** are particularly important - they establish all the public school terminology (houses, prefects, fagging, etc.) that appears constantly in adult novels. And Ransome is amazingly detailed on sailing/nautical terms and Lake District geography.

**Scotland:**

**Essential:**

- **Sir Walter Scott** - foundational for Scottish historical romance, Highland culture, clans, Jacobites
- **Robert Louis Stevenson** - _Kidnapped_, _Catriona_, Scottish history and geography
- **John Buchan** - _The Thirty-Nine Steps_, Scottish settings, espionage, establishment figures
- **Neil Munro** - Para Handy stories (Clyde puffer boats, West Highland culture)
- **Compton Mackenzie** - _Whisky Galore!_, Highland and island life
- James Hogg - "The Ettrick Shepherd," Border culture
- **Muriel Spark** - _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_, Edinburgh, Scottish gentility

**Ireland:**

**Essential:**

- **Somerville and Ross** (already mentioned) - Anglo-Irish Big House, hunting culture
- **Maria Edgeworth** - _Castle Rackrent_, Anglo-Irish estates, Irish dialect
- **Elizabeth Bowen** - Anglo-Irish perspective, _The Last September_
- Charles Lever - Irish military/social novels
- **George Moore** - Irish Literary Revival
- **Synge, Lady Gregory** - plays, rural Irish culture, Aran Islands
- **Sean O'Casey** - Dublin tenements, working-class life
- **James Joyce** - obviously, Dublin, Catholic Ireland (though complex for your purposes)

**Wales:**

- **Dylan Thomas** - _Under Milk Wood_, Welsh village life
- **Richard Llewellyn** - _How Green Was My Valley_, Welsh mining valleys
- Kate Roberts - Welsh-language writer, village life

For your dictionary, **Scott** is crucial (so many terms about Scottish clans, titles, Highland culture), and the **Anglo-Irish Big House** writers (Somerville & Ross, Edgeworth, Bowen) for understanding Irish Protestant gentry culture that appears in many English novels.

**H.E. Bates!** Absolutely should have included him.

The Larkin family novels (_The Darling Buds of May_ and sequels) are wonderful for:

- Post-WWII rural Kent countryside
- Country life, farming, orchards
- Rural dialect and expressions ("perfick!")
- Country pub culture
- Agricultural shows and country traditions
- That particular strain of earthy, warm English pastoral comedy

Bates also wrote:

- _Fair Stood the Wind for France_ - WWII
- _Love for Lydia_ - Midlands setting
- Numerous short stories about rural and small-town England

He's excellent for your dictionary because he captures a very specific mid-20th century rural English voice and way of life - the kind of thing that shaped the popular imagination of "traditional" England. The TV adaptation with David Jason made the Larkins even more culturally embedded.

Also in that vein of mid-20th century rural/regional England:

- **Laurie Lee** - _Cider with Rosie_, Cotswolds childhood, vanishing rural world
- **Flora Thompson** - _Lark Rise to Candleford_, Victorian rural Oxfordshire
- **Adrian Bell** - farming memoirs, Suffolk

These "country life" writers are gold for rural vocabulary, agricultural terms, and village customs that urban Americans would never encounter.

**Absolutely!** D.E. Stevenson is perfect for your dictionary - she's in that same wonderful vein as Angela Thirkell. Here are similar writers in that mid-20th century domestic/village fiction tradition:

**Essential in this category:**

- **D.E. Stevenson** - Mrs. Tim series, Scottish village life, wartime domestic detail
- **Miss Read (Dora Saint)** - Fairacre and Thrush Green village series, rural schoolteacher life
- **Jan Struther** - _Mrs. Miniver_, wartime middle-class London/country life
- **Elizabeth Goudge** - genteel domestic fiction, cathedral towns, villages
- **Stella Gibbons** - _Cold Comfort Farm_ (parody, but also exemplar of rural fiction)
- **Rachel Ferguson** - similar social territory to Thirkell, family sagas
- **Elizabeth Cadell** - light romances, often Scottish settings, country houses

**Slightly more literary but similar territory:**

- **Elizabeth Taylor** (the novelist, not the actress!) - subtle middle-class domestic fiction
- **Rosamond Lehmann** - more serious, but rich in social detail
- **Winifred Holtby** - _South Riding_, provincial life

**Later but in this tradition:**

- **Elizabeth Jane Howard** - Cazalet Chronicles, WWII era family saga

These writers are gold for your dictionary because they're packed with:

- Domestic vocabulary (household management, cooking, rationing)
- Village social hierarchies and customs
- Church fetes, WI meetings, local traditions
- Middle-class manners and conventions
- Wartime and post-war British life

They capture everyday British life in a way the "grander" writers sometimes don't.
