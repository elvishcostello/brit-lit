These all carry associations of Empire, exile, adventure, or "going native"!

Absolutely! Burma (now Myanmar) was a significant British colony with its own distinct terms:

**Burma-Specific:**

- Rangoon (capital, now Yangon)
- Mandalay (cultural/former royal capital - very romanticized)
- Upper Burma (annexed later, 1886)

- The Shan States (hill region/ethnic area)

**Colonial Context:** Burma was administered as part of British India until 1937, then became a separate colony. It appears frequently in:

- Orwell's _Burmese Days_ (definitive British Burma novel)
- Military memoirs (Burma Campaign, WWII)
- Kipling references

**Related Terms:**

- Punkah wallah (fan-puller - used across India/Burma)
- Dak bungalow (rest house - India/Burma)
- Dacoit (bandit - especially associated with Burma)

Burma carries associations of: remote postings, teak trade, military action, heat, and being considered even more of a "hardship posting" than India proper in the colonial imagination.
