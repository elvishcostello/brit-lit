I'll fetch and analyze that blog post for you.This blog post about John Dickson Carr's _The Ten Teacups_ (1937) contains several valuable elements for your dictionary:

## Notable Terminology & Phrases

**"Man about town"** - The blog identifies this as "a frequent type in the books" - a wealthy, lightweight, somewhat frivolous male character. Worth defining as a stock character type in British fiction.

**"Morning costume"** - Described as "full resplendent morning costume" that the character was "tightened into." This formal daywear would be worth explaining to American readers unfamiliar with British dress codes.

**"Hansom-cab"** - Used as a simile for how someone moves ("came sweeping round the corner of the door like a hansom-cab"). Historical transportation reference that adds period flavor.

## Cultural References

**"Murder in the Dark" party game** - Identified as "that popular pastime of the 1930s." The blog notes that John Curran's new book on Golden Age fiction is titled _The Murder Game_, and mentions how the killer uses planning this party game to camouflage murder preparations. This would be an excellent entry about 1930s social entertainment.

**"Lady golf champion"** - The female character Frances is described this way. Worth noting as reflecting women's participation in sport during the interwar period.

## Literary/Genre Conventions

**Carter Dickson vs. John Dickson Carr** - The blog discusses how Carr used this pseudonym, and mentions the debate about whether to distinguish between them. Several commenters note they perceive different "atmospheres" between the two names.

**"Cluefinder"** - A device where footnotes during the exposition tell readers which page contains relevant clues. Martin Edwards apparently has "close interest" in this convention.

**"GA" (Golden Age)** - The abbreviation appears multiple times, establishing this as common shorthand in British mystery discussions.

## Clothing & Social Significance

**Light summer suit details** - "no lining and no waistcoat" - The blog highlights a discussion about whether weapons could be concealed in such attire, noting this is a recurring concern in detective fiction (with examples from Christie and Christianna Brand).

**Velvet and sensuality** - Mrs. Derwent "wraps herself in velvet in a way that invites men to touch" - illustrating how fabric choices signal character and intent.

## Attitudes & Social Mores

The post extensively discusses Carr's "surprisingly open attitude to sex" for the 1930s, including frank language and biological references that were unusual for Golden Age authors. This could inform a broader entry on how British detective fiction handled sexuality versus American expectations.

The discussion of marriage and intimacy using euphemistic language ("obscure biological process—more suitable, perhaps, to a limerick than to real life") shows the characteristic British indirection even when being frank.

Would any of these areas be particularly useful for sections you're currently developing?
