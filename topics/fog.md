[[London Particular]] is the main alternative—and what a fitting name! It comes from [[Dickens, Charles]]' [[Bleak House]] where William Guppy explains to Esther Summerson: "This is a London particular…A fog, miss." The term originally described things particular to London (like a type of Madeira wine), but became synonymous with the thick fog itself. The soup by that name—thick pea and ham—got its moniker from the fog, not the other way around.

You'll also see these fogs called "black fog" or "killer fog" in references to the deadly smogs caused by coal smoke and sulfur dioxide. London itself earned nicknames like "The Big Smoke" or "The Old Smoke" from these persistent fogs.

As for Christiana Brand—you're thinking of her 1952 novel _**London Particular**_ (also published as _Fog of Doubt_). The story opens with characters driving through dense London smog to reach a murder scene, and Brand herself said it was her favorite of her own works. It features Inspector Cockrill investigating a killing that takes place during one of those legendary pea soupers. Perfect material for your British cultural dictionary!
