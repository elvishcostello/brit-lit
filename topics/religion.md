**Locum (Locum Tenens)**

A temporary replacement for an absent clergyman, literally "holding the place" (Latin). A locum might fill in for a few weeks while the regular vicar is on holiday, or for several months during an illness or between permanent appointments. The term is widely used in British English for temporary medical staff as well, which might cause confusion in period novels. A locum priest has no permanent attachment to the parish and receives a temporary stipend. In American usage, "supply priest" or "interim priest" are more common equivalents.

**Curate**

In British Anglican usage, this specifically means a **junior, assistant clergyman** - typically someone recently ordained serving their first appointment under the supervision of a vicar or rector. The curate is the lowest rank of ordained minister with actual parish duties. Despite the title, a curate often does much of the day-to-day pastoral work: visiting the sick, teaching catechism, taking some services. The position was frequently poorly paid, making curates a stock figure of genteel poverty in Victorian novels.

**Critical distinction:** Americans often use "curate" loosely to mean any clergyman in charge of a parish. In British usage, a curate is definitively _not_ in charge - they're the subordinate. The confusion arises because "perpetual curate" was a historical term for what later became "vicar," but by the 19th century, "curate" alone always meant the assistant.

**Canon**

A clergyman attached to a cathedral (rather than a parish), with several important distinctions:

- **Canon Residentiary**: A full-time, salaried position at the cathedral with administrative and liturgical responsibilities. These are working posts - usually 3-6 canons who form the cathedral chapter and manage its affairs. High status and comfortable income.
    
- **Honorary Canon**: A title of honor bestowed on a distinguished parish priest, allowing them to wear special vestments and participate in cathedral ceremonies, but carrying no duties or income. It's essentially an ecclesiastical honor, like being made an OBE.
    
- **Prebendary**: Historically, a canon who received income from specific cathedral estates (a "prebend"). By the 19th century often honorary, but the title persisted, especially at certain cathedrals like St. Paul's.
    

In social terms, a canon residentiary ranked well above a typical vicar - comparable to a bishop's immediate staff. They were often educated, well-connected men who might be addressed as "Canon Smith" rather than simply "Mr. Smith."

**Apse**

A semicircular or polygonal recess at the east end of a church, typically where the altar stands. In British churches, especially medieval ones, the apse creates a rounded sanctuary area. This is more common in older Norman/Romanesque churches; many later English Gothic churches have squared-off east ends instead. The apse often has windows (apsidal windows) and may contain the high altar or be used for private chapels. The term comes from classical Roman architecture.

**"Ladies Church" (Lady Chapel)**

Not "ladies church" but **Lady Chapel** - a chapel within a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary ("Our Lady"). In larger churches and cathedrals, this is typically a separate side chapel or extension at the east end, often elaborately decorated. In parish churches, it might be just a side altar with a statue or painting of Mary. This is a distinctly Catholic/High Anglican feature; Low Church/Protestant congregations wouldn't maintain these. When reading Victorian novels, references to someone praying "in the Lady Chapel" signal both the building's age and its liturgical tradition.

**Prior / Priory**

**Prior**: The head of a priory (second-in-command at an abbey). Female equivalent: Prioress.

**Priory**: A monastery headed by a prior rather than an abbot - generally smaller and less important than an abbey, though the distinction could be technical rather than about actual size. After Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-1541), many priory buildings were converted to other uses: parish churches, private homes, or fell into ruin. In British literature, characters often live in "the old Priory" - a former monastic building converted to a manor house, usually with romantic Gothic ruins in the grounds. These former priories retained impressive architecture (cloisters, refectories, chapter houses) and carried social prestige.

**Rood Screen**

A decorated wooden or stone screen separating the nave (where the congregation sits) from the chancel/sanctuary (where the altar stands). The key feature: it originally supported the "rood" - a crucifix (from Old English "rod" = cross) flanked by figures of Mary and John. These screens often have elaborate carved galleries and were focal points of medieval church decoration.

Critical context: During the Reformation, Protestant reformers destroyed most roods as idolatrous, but many screens survived. By the Victorian era, the rood screen became a battleground in the Oxford Movement controversy - High Church Anglicans wanted to restore them; Low Church evangelicals saw them as Popish barriers between clergy and people. In British novels, a church with an intact rood screen signals either medieval survival or Victorian Anglo-Catholic restoration.

**Sexton**

You're right to list this architecturally as well as occupationally. The sexton was the church caretaker responsible for:

- Maintaining the building and grounds
- Digging graves in the churchyard
- Ringing bells for services, weddings, funerals
- Sometimes serving as parish clerk

The sexton typically lived in a cottage on church grounds or nearby. In Gothic novels, the sexton is often a stock character: elderly, gruff, keeper of parish secrets, encountered among the gravestones. The position combined practical labor with quasi-ceremonial duties, and was generally working-class (unlike most ordained positions).

**Vestry / Vestments**

**Vestry** (the room): A side room in a church where clergy put on their vestments and where parish records are kept. Also serves as a meeting room for the "vestry" (parish council). In older churches, often located on the north side near the chancel. The vestry might contain:

- Chests for vestments and communion plate
- Parish registers (births, marriages, deaths)
- Safe for valuable items
- Sink (piscina) for ritual washing

**Vestments** (the clothing): Ceremonial robes worn by clergy during services:

- _Cassock_: The basic long black robe (ankle-length)
- _Surplice_: White linen over-garment, loose with wide sleeves
- _Alb_: White full-length tunic (more Catholic/High Church)
- _Chasuble_: Ornate sleeveless outer vestment for celebrating communion
- _Stole_: Long narrow scarf worn around the neck, color varies by liturgical season
- _Cope_: Elaborate ceremonial cape

The key British/American distinction: The degree of vestment use indicated churchmanship. Low Church evangelicals might wear only cassock and surplice (or even just ordinary clothes); High Church Anglo-Catholics adopted full Catholic vestments. In Victorian novels, elaborate vestments could signal "Romish" tendencies and spark controversy. A visiting American might be shocked by colored chasubles and embroidered copes in an Anglican service.

**Orientation Note:** Traditional churches are oriented **east-west**, with the altar at the east end (toward Jerusalem). The main entrance is typically west, with the tower at the west end. References to "north aisle," "south door," etc. assume this orientation. Some churches deviate due to site constraints, but this is the liturgical ideal.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular elements or periods?

You're right that the traditional Anglican pulpit is on the **side** (usually north side of nave) and elevated, often attached to a pillar.

A **central dais or platform** arrangement is **not typical** of classic Anglican churches from the 18th-20th centuries. That's more characteristic of:

**Nonconformist Chapels** (Methodist, Baptist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian):

- These Protestant dissenters deliberately rejected Anglican liturgical arrangements
- The pulpit becomes a central platform or dais, often quite large
- Communion table (not altar) is below or in front of pulpit
- Seating arranged in semi-circular or theater-style facing the preaching platform
- The sermon is absolutely central; sacraments secondary
- This "auditory" design prioritizes hearing the Word preached

**Key architectural distinction:**

- **Anglican**: Side pulpit + eastern altar = liturgical worship (Word AND Sacrament)
- **Nonconformist**: Central pulpit-platform = preaching-centered worship (Word above Sacrament)

**Some exceptions in Anglican churches:**

- **Extreme Low Church/Evangelical Anglican** churches in the 19th-20th centuries might move toward a more central preaching platform, but this was controversial and relatively rare
- **Modern flexible worship spaces** (late 20th century) sometimes use moveable platforms
- **"Commissioners' Churches"** (1818-1850s) - cheaply built churches for new urban areas, some had unusual layouts prioritizing preaching

**For your dictionary:** If a Victorian novel mentions someone preaching from a "central platform" or "dais," this likely signals a **Nonconformist chapel**, not an Anglican church. This would be an important social marker - Nonconformists were often middle/working class, excluded from universities and professions, politically Liberal/radical. The architecture reflects theological and social differences.

Does this distinction help for your American readers?
