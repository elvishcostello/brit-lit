Here are the major British hunting traditions and their elaborate rituals:

## FOX HUNTING (THE HUNT)

**The Organization:**

- **Master of Foxhounds (MFH)** - Runs the hunt, often wealthy landowner who subsidizes it
- **Huntsman** - Professional who actually manages the hounds (not the same as "hunter" - that's anyone riding)
- **Whippers-in** - Assistants who keep hounds together
- **Field** - Everyone else riding along

**Dress Code (very rigid):**

- **"Pink" coat** - Actually red/scarlet, but always called "pink" (after the tailor Pink, supposedly)
    - Only worn by MFH, hunt staff, and members who've "earned their button" (been awarded hunt colors)
    - Everyone else wears black coat
- **Stock** - White stock tie at throat, secured with plain gold pin
- **Breeches** - White or cream
- **Top boots** - Black with brown or tan tops (for those entitled to wear them)
- **Hunting cap or top hat** - Depending on rank
- **Ladies** wore black habits (riding outfits) with veils on their hats

**The Day:**

- **Meet** - Gathering point, often at a pub or estate, around 11am
- **Stirrup cup** - Drink (port or cherry brandy) served before moving off
- **Drawing coverts** - Searching woods for foxes
- **Gone away!** - Cry when fox breaks cover
- **View halloo** - Shout when someone spots the fox
- **Kill** or **breaking up** - When hounds catch the fox; novices might be "blooded" (fox's blood smeared on face)
- After: Return for hunt breakfast/lunch (often enormous meal despite name)

**Social aspects:**

- Deeply class-integrated: farmers, gentry, aristocracy all rode together
- Complex etiquette about gates, fences, damaged crops
- Season: November to March

## SHOOTING (GAME BIRDS)

**The Glorious Twelfth** - August 12th, start of grouse season

**Types:**

- **Grouse** - Moors in Scotland/North, most prestigious
- **Pheasant** - Bred and released, driven shoots
- **Partridge** - Also driven
- **"Walked up"** vs. **"driven"** - Walking through fields vs. beaters driving birds toward standing guns

**Driven Shoot Organization:**

- **Guns** - The shooters (8-10 gentlemen typically)
- **Beaters** - Locals employed to walk through woods/fields driving birds toward guns
- **Loaders** - Servants who reloaded guns for gentlemen (two guns per person, handed back and forth)
- **Game cart** - Collected dead birds
- **Pickers-up** - With dogs, retrieved wounded birds

**Dress:**

- **Plus-fours** or **plus-twos** - Knickerbockers with extra length
- **Tweed** - Norfolk jackets, deerstalker caps or flat caps
- **Brogues** or stout boots
- **Shooting stick** - Walking stick that unfolds into seat

**The Day:**

- Series of "drives" - different locations
- Break for elaborate lunch, often in a lodge or shooting brake (estate vehicle)
- Competition over bag size (number killed)
- Evening: Game laid out, tallied, distributed

**Etiquette:**

- Never shoot a sitting bird (unsporting)
- Never swing gun past line of other shooters
- Complex rules about which birds you can claim
- Tipping loaders and keepers expected

## DEER STALKING (Scotland)

Less social, more serious sport:

- **Stalking** in Scottish Highlands, August-October
- **Stalker** - Professional guide, crucial to success
- Crawling on belly through heather for hours
- **Ghillie** - Gillie, Highland servant/guide
- Much more about skill than socializing
- Stags taken as trophies

## HUNTING PARTIES (House Parties)

Elaborate Edwardian/Victorian affairs:

- Guests invited for long weekends or weeks
- Multiple changes of clothing daily
- Ladies didn't usually shoot, but came for meals/socializing
- Shooting was morning activity; afternoons for tea, walking
- Elaborate dinners with game featured
- Romantic intrigue common (hunt balls, country house weekends)

## KEY TERMS FOR YOUR DICTIONARY:

**Social/Class Notes:**

- Fox hunting was uniquely cross-class (farmers rode with dukes)
- Shooting was more exclusively upper-class (you needed vast estates)
- Being a good shot was essential gentlemanly accomplishment
- Women were excluded from shooting but included in fox hunting
- These activities dominated autumn/winter social calendar
- Country house parties revolved around shooting

The rituals were incredibly elaborate and served as class markers - knowing when to wear what, how to address the MFH, shooting etiquette - all separated those who belonged from those who didn't.

You're absolutely right - fishing was much less formal, though it still had class distinctions and its own traditions:

## SALMON FISHING (Most Prestigious)

**Where:**

- Scottish rivers (Tweed, Spey, Tay) - most sought-after
- Some English/Welsh rivers
- Season varies by river

**Style:**

- **Fly fishing** - Casting artificial flies
- Often done with a **ghillie** (Scottish guide/gillie)
- Wading in rivers, not boats typically
- Very skilled, patient pursuit

**Dress:**

- Tweeds, waders, fishing vest
- Deerstalker or flat cap
- No formal dress codes at all
- Practical, weatherproof clothing

**Social aspect:**

- Could be part of Scottish sporting estate holidays
- But often solitary or with just one companion
- Contemplative, meditative pursuit
- Much less about showing off than shooting

## TROUT FISHING

**Types:**

- **Chalk stream fishing** (southern England - Test, Itchen) - most refined
- **Lake/reservoir fishing**
- **Moorland streams**

**Approach:**

- Fly fishing predominantly
- "Dry fly" vs "wet fly" debates (purists insisted on dry fly only on chalk streams)
- Much discussion of technique, tackle, flies
- Requires considerable skill and knowledge

**Class associations:**

- Middle to upper-middle class pursuit
- More accessible than shooting (could rent day tickets)
- Less expensive than maintaining shooting estates
- Seen as thoughtful, philosophical sport

## COARSE FISHING (Working/Lower-Middle Class)

**What:**

- Fishing for any freshwater fish that's not salmon/trout
- Pike, perch, roach, bream, carp, tench

**Where:**

- Canals, rivers, ponds, lakes
- Much more accessible, widespread

**Style:**

- Often sitting on banks with rod and line
- Bait fishing, not fly fishing
- Float watching
- Sometimes all-day or all-night sessions

**Social:**

- Working-class male bonding
- Angling clubs, competitions
- Escape from family/work
- Much less "gentlemanly" associations

## KEY DISTINCTIONS:

**"Angling" vs. "Fishing":**

- "Angling" sounds more refined, but both terms used
- The contemplative, solitary nature appealed to intellectuals and literary types

**The Literature:**

- Walton's _The Compleat Angler_ (1653) - foundational text
- Fishing literature emphasizes philosophy, patience, communion with nature
- Very different from the blood sport aspect of hunting/shooting

**Equipment fetishism:**

- Rods, reels, flies - endless discussion
- Hardy Brothers (Alnwick) - prestigious tackle makers
- Hand-tied flies, specific patterns for conditions
- But nothing like the elaborate dress codes of hunting

**Solitary nature:**

- Could be done alone (unlike shooting which requires beaters, loaders)
- Meditative, not social
- Weather-dependent but less rigid about seasons
- Early mornings, dusk - best times

**Terms for your dictionary:**

- **Angling** - Fishing, especially with rod and line
- **Ghillie/gillie** - Scottish fishing (and hunting) guide
- **Fly fishing** - Using artificial flies as lures
- **Dry fly** - Fly that floats on surface (vs. wet fly that sinks)
- **Chalk streams** - Clear southern English streams, premium trout fishing
- **Coarse fishing** - Fishing for non-game fish (pike, perch, etc.)
- **Rise** - Fish coming to surface to feed
- **Playing** - Fighting a hooked fish
- **Landing** - Bringing fish to shore/net
- **Tickling trout** - Poaching method, catching by hand

**Class/Social Notes:**

- Salmon fishing: upper-class, Scottish estates, expensive
- Trout (fly fishing): middle to upper-middle class, contemplative
- Coarse fishing: working class, more about camaraderie
- Fishing was the "gentleman's" field sport that didn't require wealth
- Much more about skill and patience than social display
- Popular with clergymen, academics, writers - "thinking man's sport"
- Women occasionally fished (unlike shooting) but rarely
- Poaching was serious crime - salmon and trout belonged to landowners

So yes, much more informal - no pink coats, no elaborate house parties, no servants loading your rods. Just you, the river, and (hopefully) the fish.
