Your list captures some major figures, though it's a bit Churchill-heavy for the 20th century! Here are politicians who frequently appear in or get referenced in British novels:

**19th Century:**

- **William Gladstone** - Disraeli's great rival, four-time PM, absolutely essential Victorian figure
- **Robert Peel** - Founded modern Conservative party, created the Metropolitan Police (hence "bobbies" and "peelers")
- **Lord Palmerston** - Dominant mid-Victorian PM and foreign secretary
- **Lord Melbourne** - Early Victorian PM, Queen Victoria's mentor
- **Duke of Wellington** - Though more famous as a general, he was also PM

**Early 20th Century (pre-WWII):**

- **David Lloyd George** - WWI PM, Welsh Wizard, major Liberal figure
- **Ramsay MacDonald** - First Labour PM (1924 and 1929-35)
- **Stanley Baldwin** - Conservative PM three times in interwar period
- **Neville Chamberlain** - Appeasement and "peace for our time"
- **Herbert Asquith** - Liberal PM before and during early WWI

**Mid-20th Century:**

- **Anthony Eden** - Churchill's successor, Suez Crisis
- **Harold Macmillan** - "You've never had it so good," Profumo affair
- **Harold Wilson** - Labour PM 1960s-70s, pipe-smoking, "white heat of technology"

**Late 20th Century:**

- **Margaret Thatcher** - Transformative and deeply divisive, appears constantly in novels set in the 1980s-90s
- **Enoch Powell** - "Rivers of Blood" speech, frequently referenced in discussions of race and immigration
- **Tony Benn** - Left-wing Labour icon, often mentioned

Thatcher especially looms large in contemporary British fiction in a way that rivals Churchill's presence.
