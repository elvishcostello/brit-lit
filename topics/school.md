Here's the traditional middle/upper-class British educational path (important: "public school" in Britain means elite **private** boarding school, the opposite of American usage):

**Early Years (birth-8):**

- Nursery or home with governess/nanny (upper class, historical)
- Pre-preparatory school or private day school (ages 4-8)

**Preparatory School (ages 8-13):**

- "Prep school" - private, often boarding
- Prepares boys (or girls) for Common Entrance Examination
- Examples: Summer Fields, The Dragon, Ludgrove

**Public School (ages 13-18):**

- Elite boarding schools, confusingly called "public schools"
- Entry at 13 via Common Entrance exam
- The famous ones: Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, Charterhouse (the "Clarendon Nine")
- Girls' equivalents: Roedean, Cheltenham Ladies' College, Benenden
- Students organized by "forms" (not grades): Lower Fourth, Upper Fifth, etc.
- **Fifth Form:** Take O-levels (Ordinary levels) at ~16, or GCSEs after 1988
- **Sixth Form:** Final two years, studying for A-levels (Advanced levels) needed for university
    - Lower Sixth (Year 12)
    - Upper Sixth (Year 13)

**University (ages 18+):**

- **Oxbridge** (Oxford or Cambridge) - the traditional destination
- Or other universities ("reading" a subject, not "majoring")
- Three-year undergraduate degree for most subjects

**Key terms for your dictionary:**

- **Public school** - paradoxically, elite private school
- **Forms** - year groups at public schools
- **Common Entrance** - exam at 13 for public school admission
- **O-levels/GCSEs** - exams at 16
- **A-levels** - exams at 18 for university admission
- **Reading** - studying a subject at university
- **First/Second/Third** - degree classifications (like summa/magna cum laude)
- 
**Infants School:** Part of the state (government-run) education system for the youngest children, typically ages 5-7. The structure is:

- **Infants school** - ages 5-7 (Reception, Year 1, Year 2)
- **Junior school** - ages 7-11 (Years 3-6)
- Often combined as a single **primary school** covering ages 5-11
- Then **secondary school** (or "comprehensive") from 11-18

So "infants school" refers to the very first formal schooling, when children are learning to read, write, and do basic arithmetic. It's the state system equivalent of what the upper classes would handle through private pre-prep schools or governesses.

**Red Brick (or Redbrick) University:** A category of civic universities founded in major industrial cities in the late Victorian/Edwardian era (roughly 1870s-1920s). The term comes from their Victorian red brick construction.

The classic redbricks include:

- Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield

These represented the expansion of higher education beyond Oxbridge to serve the industrial middle class. They focused more on practical, scientific, and professional education rather than classics.

In social/class terms: Oxbridge was for the elite, redbrick for the aspiring provincial middle class. In novels, a character attending Manchester or Birmingham signals different social origins than one at Oxford or Cambridge - more likely middle-class, provincial, perhaps grammar school rather than public school educated. The term can carry a slight whiff of being "not quite Oxbridge," though the universities themselves are highly respected.

Scottish universities occupy a special position - they're neither Oxbridge nor redbrick, and predate most English universities outside Oxford and Cambridge.

**The Ancient Scottish Universities (pre-1600):**

- **St Andrews** (1413)
- **Glasgow** (1451)
- **Aberdeen** (1495)
- **Edinburgh** (1583)

**Their status:** These are genuinely ancient and prestigious, not part of the Victorian redbrick expansion. Edinburgh especially rivals Oxbridge in reputation, particularly for medicine, law, and philosophy (it was the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment - Hume, Adam Smith). St Andrews attracts aristocratic English students and royals (William and Kate met there).

**Key differences from English universities:**

1. **Four-year degrees** (not three) - the "ordinary" MA/BSc
2. **MA as the standard arts degree** (not BA)
3. **More democratic tradition** - the Scottish "lad o' pairts" ideal of talent over birth
4. **Different academic year and terminology**

**Social/class implications:**

Scottish universities traditionally served all classes of Scots who could manage the fees - less rigid class stratification than England. For English characters in novels, attending Edinburgh or St Andrews might signal:

- Medical ambitions (Edinburgh was _the_ place for medicine)
- Scottish family connections
- Intellectual rather than social ambitions
- Sometimes financial constraint (cheaper than Oxford)
- Or, for St Andrews, simply aristocratic alternative to Oxbridge

They're definitely not "lesser" institutions - they're a parallel tradition with their own ancient prestige.
