**UNIVERSITY TERMS (Oxford/Cambridge pattern)**

- **Michaelmas** (October-December)

- **Long Vacation** (summer) - when dons might travel, students away

**LEGAL TERMS** Similar pattern to universities, court in session during terms

**"IN TOWN" vs. "IN THE COUNTRY"**

- **Town** (London): The Season (May-August), some autumn (Parliament)
- **Country**: September-April, with breaks for hunting, house parties, Christmas
- **Scotland**: August-October (grouse shooting, stalking)

**COUNTRY HOUSE PARTIES**

- September-March: shooting parties, hunting parties
- Christmas house parties (often week-long)
- Easter parties

This calendar governed the entire rhythm of upper-class life in British novels. Missing the Season was socially catastrophic for debutantes; being invited to the right house parties determined one's social standing; and the sporting calendar (especially shooting) was almost sacred!
