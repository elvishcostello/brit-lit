#class-distinction 
Absolutely! Verbal class distinctions are a minefield in British literature. Here's the deep dive:

**THE NANCY MITFORD "U AND NON-U" DISTINCTIONS:** Upper class (U) vs. Non-upper class (non-U):

- **Lavatory** (U) vs. **toilet** (non-U) vs. **bathroom/restroom** (American/very non-U)
- **Sofa** (U) vs. **settee/couch** (non-U)
- **Looking-glass** (U) vs. **mirror** (non-U)
- **Napkin** (U) vs. **serviette** (non-U) - huge marker!
- **Pudding** (U) vs. **sweet/dessert** (non-U)
- **Vegetables** (U) vs. **greens** (non-U)
- **Dinner** at night (U) vs. **tea** for evening meal (working/middle class)
- **Luncheon/lunch** (U) vs. **dinner** at midday (working class)
- **Writing paper** (U) vs. **notepaper** (non-U)
- **Chimneypiece** (U) vs. **mantelpiece** (non-U)
- **Scent** (U) vs. **perfume** (non-U)
- **Ill** (U) vs. **sick** (non-U) - though "sick" for vomiting is fine
- **Mad** (U) vs. **mental** (non-U)
- **Rich** (U) vs. **wealthy** (non-U)
- **Die** (U) vs. **pass away/pass on** (non-U)
- **False teeth** (U) vs. **dentures** (non-U)
- **Spectacles** (U) vs. **glasses** (borderline)

**HOW TO REFER TO DWELLING PLACES:**

- **House** (U) - even for mansion
- **Home** (non-U) - "lovely home you have"
- **Residence** (very non-U/estate agent speak)
- **Lounge** (non-U) vs. **sitting room/drawing room** (U)
- **Front room** (working class)

**DRINKS:**

- **Tea** without milk specified (U assumes you'll say if you want it)
- **White/black coffee** (non-U) vs. **coffee with/without milk** (U)
- **A drink** meaning alcohol (U)
- **Champers** (U slang for champagne)
- **Sherry** as aperitif (U)

**GREETINGS & EXPRESSIONS:**

- **How do you do?** (U, not a question!) vs. **How are you?** (less formal)
- **Pleased to meet you** (non-U) - upper class just says "How do you do?"
- **Pardon?** (very non-U) vs. **What?** or **Sorry?** (U)
- **Cheers** (variable - can be U in right context)
- **Thank you** vs. **Ta** (working class)

**REFERRING TO PEOPLE:**

- **Sir/Madam** (servants to employers, formal contexts)
- **Mr./Mrs./Miss** + surname (formal)
- Use of first names (U, between equals)
- **Lady Jane** vs. **Lady Smith** - depends on rank!
- **The Hon.** - never spoken, only written
- Calling parents **Mummy/Daddy** into adulthood (U)
- **Mother/Father** (middle class formal)
- **Mum/Dad** or **Ma/Pa** (less posh)

**EUPHEMISMS & DELICACY:** Upper class often MORE direct:

- **Pregnant** (U, direct) vs. **expecting/in the family way** (middle-class euphemism)
- **Died** (U) vs. **passed away** (middle-class euphemism)
- **Lavatory** (U, frank) vs. elaborate euphemisms (non-U)

**PRONUNCIATION SHIBBOLETHS:**

- **Often** - silent "t" (U) vs. pronounced "t" (non-U)
- **Forehead** - "FORRID" (U) vs. "FOR-head" (less U)
- **Off** - without the "t": "off" not "offt"
- **-ing** fully pronounced, never "goin'" or "huntin'" in formal speech (though huntin', shootin', fishin' is affectation)
- **Schedule** - "SHED-yool" (British) vs. "SKED-yool" (American)
- **Can't, shan't** - "cahnt, shahnt" (U) vs. flat "a" (less U)
- **Bath, path, glass** - "bahth, pahth, glahss" (RP/U) vs. flat "a" (Northern/less posh)

**GRAMMAR/SYNTAX MARKERS:**

- **Shan't** (U) vs. **won't** (more common now)
- **One** for oneself (very U, can sound affected): "One doesn't do that"
- Subjunctive mood maintained: "If I were" not "If I was" (educated)
- **Got** - "Have you any?" (U) vs. "Have you got any?" (less U)
- **Gotten** - Americanism, never used

**TOPICS OF CONVERSATION:** Upper class AVOIDS:

- Discussing money directly (except among intimates)
- Asking what someone does for living upon first meeting
- Talking about possessions/purchases
- Being "gushing" or over-enthusiastic
- Discussing health in detail

Upper class DOES discuss:

- Weather (endlessly)
- Horses, dogs, shooting, country matters
- People (gossip, but discreetly)
- Politics (among equals)

**REFERRING TO SERVANTS/STAFF:**

- Servants called by surname (butler, footman)
- Or position: "the butler," "my maid"
- Ladies' maids and valets by surname
- Lower servants by first name (housemaids, kitchen staff)
- Never "the help" (Americanism)

**HOW SERVANTS ADDRESS EMPLOYERS:**

- "Sir" / "Madam" / "My Lord" / "My Lady" / "Your Grace"
- Employers' children: "Master John" / "Miss Mary" (young)
- Then "Mr. John" / "Miss Mary" (adult, still in household)
- Upper servants (butler, housekeeper) have more familiarity

**DIMINUTIVES & NICKNAMES:**

- Upper class freely use diminutives: Bunny, Ducky, Binky, Tuppy
- Double-barreled nicknames common: "Tuppie-Wuppie"
- Women often called by surname by female friends: "Hello, Carruthers!"
- "Old boy" / "old thing" / "old man" (affectionate, between equals)

**FOREIGN WORDS/PHRASES:** Upper class casually drops French:

- **En route, en suite, vis-à-vis, démodé, passé**
- But overdoing it is pretentious (middle class trying too hard)

**EXPRESSING EMOTION:** Upper class understatement:

- "Rather disappointing" (devastating)
- "Not quite the thing" (absolutely wrong)
- "A bit off" (outrageous)
- "Tiresome" (maddening)
- Avoid superlatives: not "amazing" or "incredible"

**SHOPPING & TRADESPEOPLE:**

- **Ordering from** (U) vs. **shopping at** (non-U)
- Accounts with shops, not paying cash immediately
- Having things "sent round"
- **Tradesmen's entrance** (back door)

**REFERRING TO PLACES:**

- **Town** means London (if you're U)
- **Scotland** for shooting (not "the Scottish Highlands")
- **Abroad** said with slight disdain often
- **The Continent** (Europe)

**TELEPHONE ETIQUETTE:**

- Answer with surname or number, not "hello"
- "Grosvenor 1234" or "Worthing speaking"

**LETTERS:**

- "Yours sincerely" (know the person)
- "Yours faithfully" (don't know them)
- Never "Sincerely yours" (Americanism)

**CLASS TELLS IN SPEECH RHYTHM:**

- Upper class: clipped, understated, rapid
- Middle class: more careful articulation, formal
- Working class: regional accents, different vocabulary

The key point: upper-class speech is often MORE direct and LESS euphemistic than anxious middle-class speech, which is trying hard to be "proper." And many of these distinctions were already fading by mid-20th century, making period novels tricky!

Would you like me to explore any particular category further?

Great question! Nancy Mitford **popularized** the U and Non-U terminology but didn't invent it.

**The actual origin:**

- **Alan S.C. Ross**, a linguistics professor, coined the terms "U" (Upper class) and "Non-U" (Non-Upper class) in a 1954 academic article titled "Linguistic Class-Indicators in Present-Day English" published in a Finnish philological journal - not exactly mass readership!
    
- **Nancy Mitford** read Ross's article and wrote a witty essay called "The English Aristocracy" for _Encounter_ magazine in 1955, bringing Ross's observations to a popular audience. She added her own examples and observations with characteristic humor.
    
- This caused an ENORMOUS public sensation - people were fascinated and horrified to learn they'd been marking themselves as non-U their entire lives!
    
- Both essays were collected in **"Noblesse Oblige" (1956)**, along with contributions from Evelyn Waugh and others. It became a bestseller.
    

**How far back do the distinctions date?**

The _specific vocabulary markers_ (serviette/napkin, etc.) mostly solidified in the **Victorian and Edwardian eras** (roughly 1850s-1910s) when:

- The middle class exploded in size
- Social mobility increased
- The anxious middle class tried to sound "refined" by using French-derived or Latinate words ("serviette," "toilet," "perfume")
- The established upper class stuck with older, often Anglo-Saxon terms ("napkin," "lavatory," "scent")

But _class-based linguistic distinctions_ in English go back **much further**:

- **Norman Conquest (1066)**: French-speaking Norman aristocracy vs. Anglo-Saxon peasantry created lasting divides (cow/beef, pig/pork - peasant raised it, aristocrat ate it)
- Throughout medieval and early modern periods, vocabulary and accent marked social rank

**The irony:** Many "non-U" words were adopted by the aspiring classes specifically _because_ they sounded fancier (French = elegant!), not realizing the upper class had already moved on or never used them. It's a perfect example of social climbers overcompensating.

By the 1950s, Mitford and Ross were documenting distinctions that were already starting to fade - but their documentation actually _froze_ them in the public consciousness, making people even more self-conscious about these markers!

This would be perfect context for your dictionary - especially since so many classic British novels from 1850-1950 are FULL of these markers, and readers miss the social signaling entirely.
