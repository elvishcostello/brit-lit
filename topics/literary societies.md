Given your interests in Austen, Pym, and Wodehouse, here are some British literary societies you might enjoy:

**Comedy of Manners & Social Observation:**

- **The Trollope Society** - Anthony Trollope's satirical chronicles of Victorian life would align well with your interests
- **The Dorothy L. Sayers Society** - Beyond the mysteries, Sayers offers sharp social commentary and wit
- **The Evelyn Waugh Society** - His comic novels of upper-class British life complement Wodehouse perfectly

**19th Century Classics:**

- **The Dickens Fellowship** - Essential for understanding Victorian Britain
- **The Brontë Society** - Particularly strong if you're interested in Yorkshire culture and Victorian domesticity
- **The George Eliot Fellowship** - Offers deep insights into provincial English life

**Mystery & Detection:**

- **The Baker Street Irregulars** or other Sherlock Holmes societies - Rich Victorian London culture
- **The Wilkie Collins Society** - Pioneer of the sensation novel

**Other Considerations:**

- **The Thomas Hardy Society** - If you're interested in rural English life and the West Country
- **The Wilkie Collins Society** - Victorian sensation fiction with strong social themes

Given your British cultural dictionary project, the **Trollope Society** might be particularly valuable - Trollope's novels are treasure troves of Victorian social conventions, ecclesiastical life, and the nuances of class structure. The **Dickens Fellowship** would also be excellent for the sheer breadth of Victorian life it covers.

Yes! The MLA has an extensive structure of forums (formerly called divisions) organized by period and topic, and there are also several excellent regional and specialized organizations for in-person gatherings:

## MLA Structure

The MLA has period-based forums for British literature that meet at the annual convention:

- **CLCS Medieval**
- **CLCS Renaissance and Early Modern**
- **CLCS 18th-Century**
- **CLCS Romantic and 19th-Century**
- **CLCS 20th- and 21st-Century**

Members can affiliate with up to five forums and participate in their sessions at the annual MLA convention.

## Regional MLA Conferences

Six regional MLA associations hold annual conferences with smaller, more intimate gatherings:

- **NEMLA** (Northeast Modern Language Association) - Spring conferences in the northeastern US and Canada
- **SAMLA** (South Atlantic Modern Language Association) - November conferences
- **SCMLA** (South Central Modern Language Association) - October conferences
- **M/MLA** (Midwest Modern Language Association)
- **RMMLA** (Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association)
- **PAMLA** (Pacific Ancient and Modern Language Association)

These are particularly welcoming to independent scholars and have lower attendance than the main MLA, making them more conducive to conversation.

## Specialized British Literature Organizations

**For Victorian Literature:**

- **NAVSA** (North American Victorian Studies Association) - Annual conferences rotating locations across North America
- **NVSA** (Northeast Victorian Studies Association) - Smaller spring conferences with a particularly friendly, intimate atmosphere

**For Romantic Literature:**

- **NASSR** (North American Society for the Study of Romanticism) - Annual conferences, now with virtual components

**For British Studies (More Historical Focus):**

- **NACBS** (North American Conference on British Studies) - Annual November conferences
- **NECBS** (New England Conference on British Studies) - Regional affiliate with annual fall meetings
- **PCCBS** (Pacific Coast Conference on British Studies)

Given your interest in Austen, Pym, and Wodehouse, **NAVSA** and **NVSA** would be particularly valuable. NVSA is especially known for being collegial and welcoming - no panels overlap, so you can attend everything, and there's active discussion of each paper. The British Women Writers Association conference might also interest you, though it can be competitive to get accepted.
