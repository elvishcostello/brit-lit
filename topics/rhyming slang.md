Yes, several Cockney rhyming slang terms were well-established and widely known in early 20th century London. Here are some particularly prevalent examples from that era:

**Very common terms:**

- **"Apples and pears"** (stairs) - one of the most famous, often shortened to just "apples"
- **"Plates of meat"** (feet) - frequently just "plates"
- **"Trouble and strife"** (wife) - typically shortened to "trouble"
- **"Butcher's hook"** (look) - as in "let's have a butcher's"
- **"Barnet Fair"** (hair) - shortened to "barnet"
- **"Mince pies"** (eyes) - often just "minces"

**Other well-established terms:**

- **"China plate"** (mate/friend) - shortened to "china"
- **"Daisy roots"** (boots)
- **"Whistle and flute"** (suit)
- **"Loaf of bread"** (head) - as in "use your loaf"
- **"Bees and honey"** (money)
- **"Ruby Murray"** (curry) - though this is actually mid-20th century
- **"Pen and ink"** (stink)

The key feature is that speakers often drop the rhyming word entirely, using only the first part - which makes it even more cryptic to outsiders. So "stairs" becomes "apples," "look" becomes "butcher's," etc.

These would definitely appear in early 20th century British novels, particularly those set in working-class London neighborhoods. Are you looking at incorporating these into your dictionary project?
