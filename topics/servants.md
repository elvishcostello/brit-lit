Here's the hierarchy of servants in a grand British household in the early 20th century:

**ABOVE STAIRS (Upper Servants - ate separately, had more privileges):**

**Butler** - Male head of household staff

- Managed wine cellar, silver, male servants
- Answered door, served at table, announced guests
- Highest status, often called by surname (Mr. Hudson)
- Could be quite grand and intimidating

**Housekeeper** - Female head of household (called "Mrs." even if unmarried)

- Managed female staff, household supplies, linen, china
- Kept keys to storerooms
- Authority over all housemaids and cleaning
- Often called by surname with "Mrs." (Mrs. Bridges)

**Cook** - Also called "Mrs." if unmarried

- Reigned over the kitchen
- Could be temperamental and demanding
- Elaborate meals were her domain

**Lady's Maid** - Personal maid to the lady of the house

- Dressed her, did her hair, maintained wardrobe
- Traveled with her
- High status, considerable skill required
- Called by first name by employer

**Valet** - Personal manservant to gentleman

- Dressed him, maintained clothes, shaved him
- Very close relationship with employer
- Considerable knowledge of master's private affairs

**BELOW STAIRS (Lower Servants):**

**First Footman/Second Footman:**

- Wore livery (uniform in house colors)
- Served at table, carried coal/water, heavy lifting
- Chosen partly for height and looks
- Footmen were a status symbol

**Parlour Maid** - Served tea, answered door (in households without footmen)

**Housemaids** (hierarchy of their own):

- Head housemaid
- Upper housemaid
- Under housemaid
- Cleaned, made beds, maintained fires
- Up before dawn, endless work

**Kitchen Maid** - Assisted cook

**Scullery Maid** - Lowest position

- Washed dishes, scrubbed floors and pots
- Roughest, dirtiest work
- Often very young (14-15)

**Between Maid** (or "tweeny") - Between kitchen and housework

**Hall Boy** - Odd jobs, carried coal, cleaned boots

**Nurse/Nanny** - For children (if present)

- High status, often middle-class background
- Called "Nanny" or by surname

**Governess** - Educated children (middle-class, awkward position - not quite servant, not family)

**OUTDOOR STAFF:**

**Head Gardener** - Significant authority, separate cottage **Under-gardeners** - Multiple in large estates **Gamekeeper** - Managed shooting, prevented poaching  
**Groom** - Cared for horses **Coachman** - Drove carriages (became **chauffeur** with motor cars) **Stable boys**

**KEY DISTINCTIONS:**

**"Upper" vs. "Lower" servants:**

- Upper servants (butler, housekeeper, cook, lady's maid, valet) ate separately in the housekeeper's room or butler's pantry
- Lower servants ate in servants' hall
- Upper servants were addressed by surname, lower by first name
- Rigid hierarchy even among servants

**Post-WWI collapse:** The system declined dramatically after WWI - men didn't return to service, women found other work. By the 1920s-30s, even wealthy families might have only a cook, parlour maid, and daily help rather than a full staff.

**Terms for your dictionary:**

- **Livery** - formal uniform worn by footmen
- **Below stairs** - servants' domain (basement/service areas)
- **Above stairs** - family's domain
- **Service** - being "in service" meant working as a servant
- **Situation** - a servant's job/position
