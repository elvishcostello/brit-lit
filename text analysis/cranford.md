## **Notable Observations**

This Gaskell text showcases **mid-Victorian provincial life** with:

1. **Elaborate social stratification**: The horror of being connected to "trade"
2. **Visiting rituals**: Strict 15-minute calls, three-day response rule
3. **"Elegant economy"**: Genteel poverty disguised as choice
4. **Servant terminology**: "Followers," "articles of engagement"
5. **Railroad as disruption**: New technology invading traditional life
6. **Serialized literature**: "The Pickwick Papers" in numbers
7. **Gender dynamics**: Town "in possession of the Amazons" (women)

The phrase **"vulgar" as "a tremendous word in Cranford"** perfectly captures the class-consciousness. Also notable: the ritual of **eating oranges in private** to avoid appearing like babies!

This would add wonderful Victorian provincial terminology to your dictionary!
