Yes, they are distinct!

**Butler's pantry:** Working area - for storing and polishing silver, china, glassware, and sometimes wine. This is where the butler would do final preparations before service, arrange trays, decant wine, etc. It's essentially a service room between the kitchen and dining room.

**Butler's room:** The butler's private office/sitting room. This is where he would do estate paperwork, accounts, manage household staff, and have his own small private space. More like a bedroom/office - his personal domain within the servants' quarters, reflecting his senior status.

The housekeeper would similarly have both:

- **Housekeeper's room:** Her office/sitting room (often used for morning meetings with cook, taking tea)
- **Still room:** Her working area (making preserves, cordials, etc.)

The senior servants (butler, housekeeper, sometimes cook) had these dual spaces - a working area and a private room - which marked their elevated status below stairs.

**Terms for the position:**

- Land agent (most common)
- Steward (older, more feudal term)
- Estate manager
- Bailiff (lower level, farm-focused)

**Their spaces:**

- Agent's office/estate office (business office, often in stable block or separate building)
- Agent's house (substantial separate residence on the estate)

**Key distinction:** The land agent was NOT a servant - they were a professional from the gentry or professional classes who managed the estate as a business. They handled:

- Tenant farmers and rents
- Timber sales
- Estate improvements
- Legal matters
- Accounts

The agent was actually _above_ the butler in social class, though the butler ran the household itself. The agent managed the land/estate, the butler managed the house and indoor servants.

In novels, agents appear as significant characters - think of Mr. Wickham's father being the steward at Pemberley in _Pride and Prejudice_, or the various estate agents in Trollope's novels. They could be loyal retainers or, in some plots, unscrupulous figures embezzling from absentee landlords.

The agent's house was often quite substantial - a gentleman's residence befitting their professional status.
