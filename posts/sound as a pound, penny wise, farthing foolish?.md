In the states, all bills are the same shape and color, and money values are either 1 or a multiple of 5, with the notable exception of the ill-fated [2-dollar bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_two-dollar_bill). For we Americans, British currency is an especially baffling *archaism*.

Lacking training in economics and literature too (!), we are bravely bringing you the:
## Historical exchange rate

This wonderful website (https://iamkate.com/data/uk-inflation/) has the historical rate for the pound, accounting for inflation over time. I have applied the current £ -> $ exchange rate (of 1.31) as a final step.

| Year | Value in 2025 GBP | USD   |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 1750 | £301              | $406  |
| 1775 | £205              | $276  |
| 1800 | £154              | $207  |
| 1825 | £148              | $199  |
| 1850 | £171              | $230  |
| 1875 | £153              | $206  |
| 1900 | £175              | $236  |
| 1925 | £82               | $110  |
| 1950 | £48               | $64   |
| 1975 | £14               | $19   |
| 2000 | £2.35             | $3.2  |
| 2025 | £1                | $1.35 |
These data show some remarkable inflation and deflation in the 19th century, but this is outside of my scope, and way outside of my expertise. If readers have more information at this topic, I am all ears!
## Jane Austen and the want of capital

In the regency period, people's wealth and income was common knowledge. The need for capital and income was an acute driver for many of the characters in these books.
### return on capital
It appears that ladies and gentlemen of that period could expect 5% return on their capital, but this is not stated explicitly. As with so much fiction, it is assumed that the reader knows all this, but we DO NOT, hence the object for this post.
### Pride & Prejudice
Mr Darcy is 'one of the richest men in England', and elsewhere is reported to have an income of £10,000 ($2M). No wonder he was so haughty! 

Charles Bingley is no slouch, coming in at £5000 ($1M).

Mr Bennet has £2,000 ($400K) per year from the estate of Longbourne, but the estate is **entailed** (a subject for another post), and he can leave none of it to his wife and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is something of lovable fool, and has never managed to set aside anything whatever for his family. £5,000 has been set aside for the five girls and Mrs. Bennet has £4,000 of her own. However, at 5% per annum, this is a paltry sum indeed, hence Mrs. Bennet's much mocked and misunderstood attempts to marry her daughters off.

Wickham inherited £1,000 from 'old Mr Darcy', and after squandering that and renouncing his intention to take over the **living** of Klympton, he was sent out into the world with a further £3000. This is all revealed by Darcy in his letter to Elizabeth. We don't know how he came to be in the Militia under Colonel Foster, but it must have been purchased from this sum.

Once Wickham runs away with Lydia, Darcy must again sort him out. Mr. Bennet says 'he is a fool if he takes less that £10000', but how much it really cost is not stated. Darcy would have had to settle his many debts and purchase another commission in the regulars, which would have cost perhaps £1000.

The obsequious Mr. Collins had the 'Hunsford Living', which was **in the gift** of the magnificent Lady Cathering De Bourgh. The value is not explicitly stated, but we might estimate it to be around £1000. The unfortunate Anne De Bourgh is known to have a fortune of £30,000, but seemingly few other attractions.
### Sense & Sensibility

Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters are unceremoniously turned out of Norland and sent to fend for themselves with £10000 settlement as well as £1000 for each daughter. This would produce a nominal £650 per annum for the 4 women to live on, hence the need for a 'cottage'. The terms of the let from Sir John Middleton, are understood to be very favorable, but not spelled out.

WIth $130k (in current USD), it seems like the Dashwoods would have been comfortable, but of course none of the daughters could bring very much value to any future marriage match. At this income, they are unable to keep a carriage, and have just a couple of servants.

The perfidious WIlloughby finds himself completely unable to live within his income of £600 to £700 (citation needed), hence his betrayal of Mariane. In the end, he lands himself in a loveless marriage with Miss Grey who is known to have £50,000. In the end, he repents, but he does so from comfort.

Stolid, reliable Colonel Brandon comes in with £2,000 per annum and a very good estate. These are no inducements for Marianne, but love wins in the end!

Edward, meanwhile has no means whatsoever until Brandon grants him the living at Delaford. This is worth only £200 per year, and Brandon is quite apologetic that he cannot make it more. The sensible Elinor would have managed it, but in the end the impossible Mrs. Ferrars grants him a further £10000, allowing us to imagine Elinor and Edward's life at a country parsonage to be entirely comfortable.
## Sherlock Holmes

Holmes takes most of his cases based on their novelty (and the interest of Watson's public, and by extension, ours). He does not  greatly care for wealth beyond funding his reading, experiments, music and his chaotic lodgings at **221B Baker St**. The fees he _does_ take are seldom explicitly mentioned, but in _The Priory School_, he very happily trousers a £6000 pound note ($1.2M!!).

However, when '**the game is afoot'** he pays out lots of coins to the **baker street irregulars**, cab men, and what have you. These make a great introduction to the mysterious world of British coinage, to be covered in depth in the next post. Here's a quick preview:

* half a crown - a typical tip to the irregulars, or a cab man

Half a crown == 2 shillings and six-pence == 1/8 of a pound == $20USD
