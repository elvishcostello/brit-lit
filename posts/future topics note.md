**How this was calculated:** I used UK inflation multipliers showing how much £1 from each historical year would be worth in 2025 pounds, then converted to USD using the current exchange rate of approximately $1.31 per pound.

**Key takeaways:**

- The pound has experienced over 10,600% cumulative inflation since 1800
- A pound in the early 1800s had tremendous purchasing power - roughly equivalent to $200-225 in today's money
- The 20th century saw accelerating inflation, especially after abandoning the gold standard
- The purchasing power declined most dramatically between 1925-1975, likely due to the wars and post-war inflation

Note: These figures represent the purchasing power of £1 adjusted for inflation in both currencies, showing what goods and services that pound could buy expressed in today's dollars.
