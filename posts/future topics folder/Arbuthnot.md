I'll search for information about the name "Arbuthnot" in British literature for you.Excellent observation! You're absolutely right about all three, and there are quite a few more. Here's what I found:

**Confirmed:**

- **E.F. Benson's Dodo series**: Edith Arbuthnot appears in "Dodo Wonders" (the third book) as a musical conductor who has a husband named Bertie and a daughter Madge
- **Dorothy Sayers**: The Honourable Freddy Arbuthnot is a friend of Lord Peter Wimsey, works in finance, and is married to Rachel (who was Rachel Levy)
- **P.G. Wodehouse**: Freddie Arbuthnot appears in the Bertie Wooster stories

**Other notable uses:**

- **Oscar Wilde**: Mrs. Arbuthnot and her son Gerald Arbuthnot in "A Woman of No Importance"
- **Agatha Christie**: Colonel Arbuthnot in "Murder on the Orient Express" - a British soldier who was a friend of Colonel Armstrong
- **Elizabeth von Arnim**: Frederick Arbuthnot in "The Enchanted April"
- **Ray Bradbury**: James Charles Arbuthnot in "A Graveyard for Lunatics"
- **Gregory Mcdonald**: Fredericka "Freddy" Arbuthnot in several books

The surname seems to have been particularly popular with British authors writing about upper-class characters - it's got that aristocratic Scottish ring to it (it derives from a Scottish village). Interesting how several authors chose very similar names - both Sayers and Wodehouse have a "Freddy/Freddie Arbuthnot"!

This could make a great entry for your Cross Pond Reader - "Arbuthnot" as a recurring aristocratic surname in British fiction.

Absolutely! Yes, there's a real Arbuthnott family in Debrett's (and Burke's Peerage):

**Viscount of Arbuthnott** - Created in 1641 in the Peerage of Scotland, still extant today (currently the 17th Viscount). The family has held the same lands near Inverbervie, Kincardineshire since around 1188 - one of the longest unbroken male lines in Scottish history. The Viscount of Arbuthnott is also the hereditary chief of Clan Arbuthnott.

**Two Arbuthnot Baronetcies** (both still extant):

- Created 1823 for Sir William Arbuthnot, Lord Provost of Edinburgh
- Created 1964 for Sir John Sinclair-Wemyss Arbuthnot

This makes the fictional usage even more perfect! British authors were borrowing from a genuine ancient Scottish noble family - it would have given their fictional aristocrats instant authenticity. Readers in the know would recognize "Arbuthnot" as a real title, while the fictional first names (Freddy, Edith, etc.) kept them clearly fictional.

Interestingly, the real Viscount still uses the traditional Scottish style "Viscount **of** Arbuthnott" (with the "of" and the double-t spelling), which most other Scottish viscounts have dropped.

This is gold for your Cross Pond Reader - American readers would have zero idea these fictional Arbuthnots are echoing a real 800-year-old titled family!
