British Currency was rationalized in 1971. Prior to this point their coinage was a delightful example of British oddness. Here's a table clarifying each of the denominations:

**British Currency Values (Pre-Decimal System, pre-1971)**

- **Farthing**: ¼d (~0.1p) - Smallest coin; discontinued 1960
- **Ha'penny (halfpenny)**: ½d (~0.2p) - Also called "coppers"
- **Penny**: 1d (~0.4p) - Copper coins
- **Tuppence (twopence)**: 2d (~0.8p)
- **Tuppenny ha'penny**: 2½d (~1p) - Often used dismissively to mean worthless
- **Thruppence (threepence)**: 3d (~1.25p) - "Thruppenny bit"
- **Groat** was a silver coin worth four pence (4d).
- **Joey (slang)**: 4d (~1.7p) - Rare by Victorian era - named after Joseph Hume, an MP who advocated for reintroducing a four-pence coin in the 1830s-1840s. 
- **Tanner (slang)**: 6d (~2.5p) - Sixpence

### Orwell on poverty
In George Orwell's 'Keep the Asipidistra Flying', Gordon Comstock has a single 'joey' in his pocket and does not believe that he can use it, without embarrasment. Why?

### Lewis Carroll

The Mad Hatter's 'In this style' hat is priced at '10 and 6'.

**10/6** means **10 shillings and 6 pence** (10s 6d)

The notation uses the **solidus** (/) to separate shillings from pence. This was the standard way to write prices in pre-decimal Britain.

**Breaking it down:**

- 10 shillings = 120 pence
- Plus 6 pence
- Total: 126 pence or half a guinea (10s 6d)
