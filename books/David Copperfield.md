## **Notable Observations**

This Dickens passage shows **early Victorian domestic life** with:

1. **Caul superstition**: Belief it prevented drowning (advertised for sale!)
2. **Complex money system**: Guineas, pounds, shillings, pence, halfpence
3. **Class through speech**: "an't," "Lawk," "mayn't" marking class
4. **Childhood perspective**: Young David's limited understanding ("Brooks of Sheffield")
5. **Domestic hierarchy**: Servants, governesses, social distinctions
6. **Medical practices**: Home births, doctors making house calls
7. **Victorian prudery**: Adults spelling words children shouldn't understand
8. **Floor numbering**: "Two pair of stairs" = third floor (British counting)

The phrase **"meandering about the world"** (applied to sailors) and Dickens' playful **"Not to meander myself, at present"** is delightful!
