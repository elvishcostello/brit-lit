## **Notable Observations**

This Austen text is **rich in Regency-era social terminology** that's uniquely British:

1. **Income as identity**: "five thousand a year" defines social status
2. **Entailment**: uniquely British legal practice limiting inheritance
3. **Assembly culture**: public balls as main social venue
4. **Visiting protocols**: elaborate formal calling customs
5. **Class through occupation**: "in trade" as social marker
6. **Michaelmas**: one of four "quarter days" for rents/contracts

The language also shows **period British grammar**:

- "Three-and-twenty years" instead of "twenty-three"
- "To-morrow" instead of "tomorrow"
- Different use of present perfect tenses

This would be excellent material for your dictionary, especially for historical British fiction!
